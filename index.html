      <h1> Welcome To My Page</h1>
      <p> This webpage is designed by me and was created using github. I will go over basic information about myself, javascripts, and <br>
            apps in the above tabs. This website is the first assignment of computer science 106 and it is the first webpage I have ever <br> 
            created. I am interested in computer science not only because it is very practicle in today's society but it is the next chapter <br> 
            into the future as well.</p>
