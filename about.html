            Hi my name is Nick Rizzo. Im a sophmore here at URI, currently majoring in Buisness. Im from South<br> 
            Kingstown, Rhode Island. Some things I enjoy doing is watching the Patriots and playing basketball<br> 
            with my friends. One fun fact about me is I'm a triplet. I have one brother and one sister, who also<br>
            go to URI. I have an interest in computer science, and I may decide to minor in it depending on how<br>
            this class goes. So far I have learned quite a bit in the first couple weeks of classes. Unfortunatly<br>
            I have no prior experience with computer science so this semester is going to be a challenge for me,<br>
            I'm looking foward to it! </p>
