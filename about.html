            Hi my name is Nick Rizzo. Im a sophmore here at URI, currently majoring in Buisness. Im from South Kingstown, Rhode<br>
            Island. Some things I enjoy doing is watching the Patriots and playing basketball with my friends. One fun fact<br>
            about me is I'm a triplet. I have one brother and one sister, who also go to URI. I have an interest in computer<br>
            science, and I may decide to minor in it depending on how this class goes. So far I have learned quite a bit in the<br>
            first couple weeks of classes. Unfortunatly I have no prior experience with computer science so this semester is<br>
            going to be a challenge for me, I'm looking foward to it! </p>
